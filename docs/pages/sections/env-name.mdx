The `name` option expects a string stating the name of the config variable that will be used to reference it within the remainder of the configuration.

> The `name` of a config variable must be unique and is mandatory when defining a config variable.

> If the user will be asked to provide a value, the value will be cached in `.devspace/generated.yaml`.
