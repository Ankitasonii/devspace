import SectionDependencyNamespace from '../../sections/dependency-namespace.mdx';
import SectionDependencyName from '../../sections/dependency-name.mdx';


## Example
```yaml
dependencies:
- source:
    path: ./different/subproject
- source:
    path: ./different/another-subproject
```

:::warning
Using local projects with `path` option makes the configuration in `devspace.yaml` harder to share compared to [`git` based dependencies](../../configuration/dependencies/git-repository.mdx) and is therefore discouraged.
:::

## `source`

### `source.path`
The `source.path` option expects a string with a relative path to a folder that contains a `devspace.yaml` which marks a project that is a dependency of the project referencing it.

#### Example: Local Project as Dependency
```yaml
dependencies:
- source:
    path: ../other-project
- source:
    path: ./different/subproject
```
**Explanation:**  
- Whenever you run `devspace deploy` or `devspace dev`, DevSpace will:
  - Load the `devspace.yaml` files of both dependencies and resolve their dependencies respectively.
  - Deploy both projects according to their `devspace.yaml` files.
